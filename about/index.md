My name is Saumil Patel.

I'm  a software engineer and graduate from University of Johannesburg as well as University of Pune.

I like to work with simple things - things can help do day to day job easier for any software developer.
Most of the time i am behind a computer trying to find better ways to solve problems. And, obviously i pick up few new things now and then when trying to find solutions.
