on last few projects, i've realized that use of closures can come really handy in day-to-day work.\nCan you imagine writing loops after loops to extract or collect properties from list of custom objects? It can be tiring and painful. And hence, I have decided to add this post - mainly to point out couple of situations where introduction to closures can really ease this pain.\nMost of you must have used Project Lambok or Functional Java to achive this. Unfortunately not everyone gets the choice to be able to use opensource libraries. Yeah, there are clients who prefers to avoid use of opensource libraries in this day and age, can you believe it ? Anyways, i have tried to point out some of the features offerred by closures in this post.\nBefore going forward in more details, let's try and understand what closures mean in Java and what it can bring on the table.\nA Closure is a first class function or reference to a function together with a referencing environment. Most of the time, function types, anonumous functions and inline function-valued expressions are also refered as closures in java. An anonymous function that contains some context surrounding it as a snapshot &amp; can be passed as a parameter. The definition of closure can be broken down into two main parts - callbacks and contextual information surrounding this callback function.\nPlease note, Anonymous classes in java are close to being called as closures, but they do not fully support definition of closure. But they come close to it and hence you can find lot of literature calling anonymous inner classes as closures. The main reason behind not supporting definition, is due to the fact that inner class can only access final local variable of the enclosing method. And also, because these variables get created and stored in a stack, they get destroyed when execution of the method completes and result gets returned. And If you want to make an anonymous inner class as a closure, it should be allowed to access all the fields surrounding body - which is not permissible by current memory management.\nEnough with the explanation, let's look at some of the examples!\nIn pre Java 8, versions we can simulate closures\n\nWe can use this interface to emulate anonymous inner class easily. Below mentioned methods can be used to perform simple comparison tasks and can be later extended to combine with interface Funct&lt;A,B&gt; to simulate closures.\nMethod to retrieve larger values compared to provided comparison value:\n\nAnother method to determine smaller value compared to provided comparison value:\n\nThese method are very identical - except the conditions. These can be combined using above mentioned interface like this:\n\nThis method can be used as :\n\nOther few examples can be found in (progfun)[https://github.com/SaumilP/java-progfun].\nIn Java 8, streams can be used to make use of newly added feature - lambda expressions.\n\nIt is less verbose compared to older version of the code, but it gives neat and short presentation of the code.\nDevelopers can focus more on the work getting done instead of worrying about getting syntax correct.\nI will add more Java 8 examples in next post.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/closures-in-java/","title":"Closures in Java"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/currying-function-in-java/":{"body":"Currying is a technique of transforming a function with multiple arguments into a function with just single argument. The single argument is the value of the first argument from the original function and it returns another single argument function. This in turn would take the second original argument and itself return another single argument function. This kind of chaining continues over the arguments of the original. The last in the chain will have access to all the arguments and so can do whatever it needs to do.\nYou can turn any function with multiple arguments into its curried equivalent. Lets have a look at the Curryied function in Java 7 vs Java 8.\n \nJava7\nFor example, we have a function add specified below\n\nThis can be curried into something like this ( where Function&lt;A,B&gt; defines a single method B apply(A a))\n\nNow lets check the calling these functions, first original method\n\nand calling our curried function\n\n \nJava 8\nIn Java 8, its is much less verbose using lambda syntax compared to Java 7 Example.\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/currying-function-in-java/","title":"Curried Function in Java"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/quick-solr-setup/":{"body":"It has been long time since I started with setup/configuration related blog post.

Run below command from terminal to update document before querying indexed documents.\n\nIf above command runs successfully without any errors, document will get indexed. After then, in order to query below command can be used:\n\nAbove will return queried documents specified below:\n\nIf you analyze response, you can see the unique identifier was automatically generated. Now if you run same commands ( addition of document &amp; query ) then result would looks like this:\n\nAs you can see both documents show two different unique identifier generated by solr.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/unique-id-generation-in-solr/","title":"Automatic ID generation in Apache Solr"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/xml-schema-design-patterns/":{"body":"This might be one of the old topic - specially when lot of developers are working with RESTful Services, but i would like to point out couple of pros and cons.\nAs most of the developers know, XML schema is very powerful, but they lack object-orientation, and are intended to capture a data model rather than an object model. In last one and half decades, there has been few tools available to architects and developers to be able to make use off some of the object orientation principles - like polymorphism for flexibility. But ultimately the whole point of the services must be general enough that it can communicate across languages. Hence i have attempted to put together some information around some of the very well known Design patterns.\nSome of the XML Schema design patterns include Russian Doll, Venetian Blind &amp; Salami Slice.\n \nRussian Doll\n\nLet us have a look at Russian Doll Design pattern. As name indicates - this design pattern permits single global root element which contains constituent types. All element declarations are nested inside the root element, and can therefore only be used once in within the context.\nSome of the characteristics of this pattern are:\n\nIt has a single global root Element\nAll the types are local\nIt supports only schemas designed in a single file\nExposed schema is fully encapsulated\nIt has high cohesion with minimal coupling\nEasy to read and write\n\nOne of the ceavet while considering this patter, do not use this pattern when you would want to reuse types.\nEnough with the theory, let's have a look at the example.\n\nEquivalent Xml Schema Document can be found below:\n\nAs you can see, above schema defines a single global element Production and it is easy to read and write because there is no mixing. The types required to create a production element are all the nested within it. Elements and types cannot be referenced, and Namespaces are localized. And because it is self-contained, changing types will not affect other schemas.\nOne of the biggest disadvantages of this pattern with respect to straight XML is that the types you carefully defined cannot be reused elsewhere, hence causing very large schema.\nThis design pattern is perhaps an appropriate design to use when wrapping legacy data from a source that is fairly static.\n \nSalami Slice\n\nThis pattern represents opposite end of the design spectrum from Russian Doll.\nBy using this pattern, use can declare all the elements as global, but declare all types locally. Pattern is named as Salami Slice because of the ability to set all the elements in global namespace and to make them reusable - which acts as a single definition slice. These slices can be used to combined with others for better reusablility.\nWith this pattern, schema can have more components, all defined individually - which are then brought together into global elements. This pattern is entirely open, allowing a wide variety of possible combinations compared to its counter part pattern Russian Doll - which is absolutely rigid and inflexible. Physical structure of the Russian Doll allows only one way to put the constituents toghether, while slices offer no guidance for how they might be arranged in schema.\nSome of the characteristics of this pattern are:\n\nAll elements are global\nAll elements are defined within global namespace\nAll types are local\nElement declarations are never nested\nElement declarations are reusable.\nIt is difficult to determine intended root element, as there can be many potential choices.\n\nExample from Russian Doll has been redesigned and represented differently with salami slice:\n\nEquivalent Xml Schema Document can be found below:\n\nThe main advantage of this pattern is that becuase the elements are declared globally, schema is reusable. But because changing an element affects the composing elements, this pattern is considered tightly coupled.\nThis schema design pattern are verbose and are clearly arranged and flat.\n \nVenetian Blind\n\nThis pattern is an extension of Russian Doll Pattern. It contains only one signle global root element. It departs from Russian Doll in that it allows for reuse of all the types as well asd the global root element.\nUse of this pattern means that schema designer wants to define a single global root element for instanciantion and compose it with externally defined types. This has the benefit of miximiizing reuse.\nSome of the characteristics of this pattern are:\n\nIt has a single global root element\nIt mixes global and local declarations\nIt has high cohesion but also high coupling\nIt maximizes reuse of all the types.\nEncapsulation is limited due to types being exposed.\nIt allows designers to use multiple files to define schema\nIt is verbose. Breaking apart each type in a way provides very selective, granular control over each individual aspect on the element, but makes for a lot of typing.\n\nOriginal Example from Russian Doll has been redesigned and represented differently with salami slice:\n\nEquivalent Xml Schema Document can be found below:\n\nBecause this pattern has more flexibiliy, it is de-facto design pattern during XML Design pattern. There are several other patterns - like Garden of Eden and Chameleon - make uses of these basic patterns to solve other issues. I will try and attend rest of the patterns in next part.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/xml-schema-design-patterns/","title":"XML Schema Design Patterns"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1111/":{"body":0,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/about/":{"body":92,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/2024/":{"body":0,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/closures-in-java/":{"body":299,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/currying-function-in-java/":{"body":98,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/quick-solr-setup/":{"body":43,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/unique-id-generation-in-solr/":{"body":137,"title":5},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/xml-schema-design-patterns/":{"body":490,"title":4}},"length":8},"lang":"English"};
