I'm  a software engineer with gradute degrees from University of Johannesburg and University of Pune.

I work on things that helps in doing day-to-day work easily. In doing so, I try and work smartly overcoming some of the legacy difficulties. This blog site is an attempt to evaluate different options available to software engineers now a days.

Most of the time i am behind a computer trying to find better ways to solve problems. And, obviously i pick up few new things now and then when trying to find solutions.
